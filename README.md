# 🩺 Medical Disease Detection System (Java)

## 📖 Project Description
The Medical Disease Detection System is a Java-based console application designed to analyze user-input symptoms and identify possible diseases. Based on the symptoms provided, the system predicts common medical conditions and suggests basic treatments along with an estimated recovery duration.

This project is developed using core Java concepts and is intended for educational purposes. It helps demonstrate logical decision-making, user interaction, and conditional processing in Java applications.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This application does not replace professional medical advice and should be used only for learning and demonstration purposes.
